# Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy

Canonical reference for SCT-001 through SCT-012.

---

## SCT-001: Emotional Hijacking

**Exploiting affective processing to bypass rational evaluation.**

- Cyber analog: Urgency in phishing emails
- Cognitive analog: Outrage farming, fear-based messaging

Indicators:
- Strong emotional trigger (fear, anger, disgust, excitement)
- Call to immediate action before reflection
- Consequences framed as urgent or irreversible
- Emotional language disproportionate to content

---

## SCT-002: Information Asymmetry Exploitation

**Leveraging what the target does not know.**

- Cyber analog: Zero-day exploits
- Cognitive analog: Selective disclosure, cherry-picked statistics

Indicators:
- Critical context omitted
- Statistics without denominators or timeframes
- Source material unavailable or paywalled
- Claims that cannot be independently verified

---

## SCT-003: Authority Fabrication

**Manufacturing trust signals the source does not legitimately possess.**

- Cyber analog: Certificate spoofing, credential theft
- Cognitive analog: Fake experts, astroturfing, credential inflation

Indicators:
- Credentials that cannot be verified
- Institutional affiliation without evidence
- Appeal to unnamed experts or studies
- Visual markers of authority without substance

---

## SCT-004: Social Proof Manipulation

**Weaponizing herd behavior and conformity instincts.**

- Cyber analog: Watering hole attacks, typosquatting popular sites
- Cognitive analog: Bot networks simulating consensus, fake reviews

Indicators:
- Claims about what "everyone" thinks or does
- Manufactured engagement metrics
- Bandwagon framing ("join the movement")
- Artificial scarcity combined with popularity claims

---

## SCT-005: Identity Targeting

**Attacks calibrated to the target's self-concept and group affiliations.**

- Cyber analog: Targeted spearphishing using personal data
- Cognitive analog: Identity-based narrative capture, in-group/out-group exploitation

Indicators:
- Content addresses specific identity groups
- In-group/out-group framing
- Challenges to identity trigger defensive response
- Personalization based on known attributes

---

## SCT-006: Temporal Manipulation

**Exploiting time pressure, temporal context, or scheduling.**

- Cyber analog: Session hijacking, time-based attacks
- Cognitive analog: News cycle exploitation, artificial deadlines, crisis amplification

Indicators:
- Artificial deadlines or expiration
- Exploitation of current events for unrelated agenda
- Time-limited offers or threats
- Strategic timing of information release

---

## SCT-007: Recursive Infection

**Self-replicating patterns where the target becomes the vector.**

- Cyber analog: Worms, supply chain attacks, training data poisoning
- Cognitive analog: Viral misinformation, memetic structures, wetiko patterns

Indicators:
- Strong compulsion to share before evaluating
- Content survives paraphrase (message persists in retelling)
- Multiple unconnected people arriving at identical framing
- Resistance to examining where the belief originated
- Sharing serves the operation regardless of agreement/disagreement

---

## SCT-008: Direct Substrate Intervention

**Physical/electrical modification of neural hardware bypassing informational processing.**

- Cyber analog: Hardware implant, firmware rootkit
- Cognitive analog: Electrode stimulation, ECT depatterning, TMS, deep brain stimulation

Indicators:
- Behavioral changes with no corresponding informational input
- Subject confabulates explanations for externally-induced behaviors
- Cognitive changes following procedures exceeding stated scope
- Behavioral outputs inconsistent with stated beliefs, cause unidentifiable

---

## SCT-009: Chemical Substrate Disruption

**Pharmacological modification of neurochemical operating environment.**

- Cyber analog: Environmental manipulation, resource exhaustion attacks
- Cognitive analog: Psychoactive administration, engineered dopamine loops, cortisol spike induction

Indicators:
- Emotional response disproportionate to content
- Decision patterns consistent with altered neurochemical states
- Compulsive engagement patterns (doom scrolling, behavioral dopaminergic capture)
- Post-exposure cognitive state inconsistent with content consumed

---

## SCT-010: Sensory Channel Manipulation

**Control, denial, or overload of sensory input channels.**

- Cyber analog: DDoS, network isolation, man-in-the-middle
- Cognitive analog: Sensory deprivation, information overload, infinite scroll, algorithmic feed substitution

Indicators:
- Information environment completely controlled by single source
- Input volume exceeds processing capacity (notification flooding)
- Authentic information replaced with operator-controlled substitutes
- Subject unable to access alternative information sources

---

## SCT-011: Trust Infrastructure Destruction

**Targeted compromise of social trust networks to disable collective cognition.**

- Cyber analog: PKI compromise, certificate authority attack, DNS poisoning
- Cognitive analog: Bad-jacketing, institutional delegitimization, manufactured distrust

Indicators:
- Systematic discrediting of trust anchors (media, science, institutions)
- False flag operations attributed to trusted entities
- Manufactured evidence of betrayal within trust networks
- Generalized distrust promoted as sophisticated thinking

---

## SCT-012: Commitment Escalation & Self-Binding

**Exploiting subject's own behavioral outputs as capture mechanisms.**

- Cyber analog: Ratchet exploit, privilege escalation through accumulated permissions
- Cognitive analog: Self-criticism sessions, loyalty tests, public commitment traps, sunk cost capture

Indicators:
- Sequential commitment requests escalating in cost
- Public declarations that create social binding
- Active participation requirements (vs passive consumption)
- Self-generated content used as evidence of genuine belief
